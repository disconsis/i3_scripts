# set this to 'False' (unless you want to things to break T.T)
# debug: False causes find_apps.py to ignore exceptions when something breaks
# debug: True is mostly for me (or anyone who wants to test/develop)
# It causes the script to raise exceptions (and stop working)

debug: False

# colors for currently and last focused windows' glyphs
# these can either be X11 color names (wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names#Color_name_chart)
# or an RGB color specification (#RRGGBB)
#        ^ this needs to be wrapped in quotes since '#' is a comment in yaml
# since i3 v4.12, i3bar also supports transparency, so you can use RGBA colors too
colors:
    focused:                cyan
    last focused:           light goldenrod
